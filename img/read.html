							Apple realized that there is a set of things that all software has to do, so why shouldn’tthey all do them the same way? If they did, software would be easier to develop anddebug, but more important—it would be easier to use. If there was only one way tocreate menus, then once a user learned how to use the menus of one app, he wouldalready know how to use the menus of all others. The same is true with scrollbars,windows, the keyboard, the mouse, printing, and sound.

					<p>I was a software developer before Mac existed, so I remember how the tech industry
					reacted to it. For the most part, the community reacted with a fair amount of skepticism.The interesting thing is that the negative things people say about Bootstrap today sound exactly like the negative things people said about the Mac in 1984. And in both cases,the things that people didn’t like were what made them important
